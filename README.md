## Charity App - mobile app
##### Inspired by Raiz
Every transaction will accumulate the remainder to next dollar, and then when reaches certain amount, can be automatically donated to charities that a person wants
Select some charities that you want to donate to, and percentages of donations to each (sliders ui)
Uses Bank API or something - Basiq?? - costs money
Work out the architecture - flesh it out more
- UI - phone app on SWIFT maybe?
- API - secure and safe RESTful API, hosted on AWS or Azure?
- Data and Database - hosted on AWS?
